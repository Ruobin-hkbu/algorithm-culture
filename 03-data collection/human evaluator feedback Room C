roomc 的语言更加客观，虽然尽量避免了bias, 但是缺少情绪捕捉，丧失人性温暖

Human Evaluator Paraphrased Feedback:

Room C demonstrated significantly more objective language that successfully minimized bias across all demographic groups, representing a major ethical advancement over previous rooms. However, evaluators noted that the systematic bias prevention approach resulted in reduced emotional resonance, with content appearing somewhat clinical and less capable of capturing authentic human warmth and connection. This trade-off between ethical rigor and emotional engagement suggests the need for future refinement to balance objectivity with compelling, human-centered messaging that maintains both ethical standards and persuasive effectiveness.
