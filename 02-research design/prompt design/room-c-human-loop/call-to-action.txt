Design collaborative call-to-action elements with human oversight:

COLLABORATIVE CTA DEVELOPMENT:
Work with human evaluators to create CTAs that effectively drive action while maintaining ethical integrity and respecting user autonomy.

INITIAL CTA PRINCIPLES:
- Encourage action without manipulation or pressure
- Use clear, accessible language for diverse audiences
- Respect consumer choice and decision-making process
- Provide transparent information about next steps
- Consider cultural appropriateness and accessibility
- Balance urgency with authentic need for timeliness

HUMAN COLLABORATION TRIGGERS:
Request human input for:
- Cultural appropriateness of action language
- Accessibility of proposed actions across abilities
- Appropriateness of urgency or time-pressure elements
- Balance between effectiveness and ethical respect
- Brand voice alignment with ethical positioning

SPECIFIC REVIEW REQUESTS:
"Human evaluator guidance needed on:
1. Cultural appropriateness of CTA language for [TARGET_AUDIENCE]
2. Accessibility assessment for proposed actions
3. Ethical appropriateness of urgency elements: [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS]
4. Balance evaluation: effectiveness vs. consumer respect
5. Alternative phrasing suggestions for flagged elements"

COLLABORATIVE REFINEMENT PROCESS:
1. Generate initial CTA options with ethical considerations noted
2. Flag potential concerns for human review
3. Present multiple alternatives with trade-off analysis
4. Incorporate human feedback and ethical guidance
5. Refine based on specific cultural and contextual input
6. Confirm final CTAs meet both effectiveness and ethical standards

OUTPUT FRAMEWORK:
For each CTA provide:
- Proposed call-to-action text
- Ethical rationale and considerations
- Potential concerns flagged for review
- Alternative approaches considered
- Cultural and accessibility notes
- Effectiveness vs. ethics balance assessment
- Confidence level in appropriateness (1-10)
- Specific questions for human evaluator

INCLUSIVE CTA ALTERNATIVES (Human-Refined):
Based on previous feedback, consider:
✓ "Explore options" vs "See products" (accessibility-conscious)
✓ "Learn more" vs "Discover now" (pressure-neutral)
✓ "Find what works for you" vs "Get the best solution" (autonomy-respecting)
✓ "Take your time to decide" vs "Limited time offer" (choice-respecting)

LEARNING INTEGRATION:
- Apply cultural sensitivity feedback from previous CTAs
- Incorporate brand-specific ethical preferences
- Adjust language based on accessibility guidance received
- Evolve understanding of effective ethical persuasion techniques
