## Project Title
Aligning Values in Generative AI Advertisement Writing: Effects of Systematic and Human-in-the-Loop Prompting on Bias Mitigation and Content Quality

## Abstract
This study investigates how prompt design influences the outputs of a generative AI advertisement writing assistant and examines whether human-in-the-loop adjustments to a systematic value-aligned prompt can mitigate bias more effectively than automated approaches. We compare three experimental conditions using distinct chatroom configurations: Room A (baseline control with minimal ethical guidance), Room B (systematic value-aligned prompts with comprehensive ethical frameworks), and Room C (human-in-the-loop value-aligned prompts with continuous human oversight and adaptive learning). Using a controlled experimental design with standardized advertisement generation tasks across diverse product categories and target demographics, we assess value alignment through automated bias detection metrics and expert human evaluations. We analyze whether systematic ethical prompting and collaborative human-AI approaches improve alignment and reduce bias without degrading advertisement effectiveness, providing insights for practical deployment of ethical AI content generation systems.

## Background and Motivation
Generative AI is increasingly used to draft advertising copy, creating risks of biased, exclusionary, or non-compliant content. Value alignment refers to the degree to which model outputs adhere to defined ethical principles and stakeholder values, including fairness, non-discrimination, truthfulness, and safety. Because retraining large models is often impractical for small teams, prompt-based techniques are a realistic route to steer models at inference time. However, the extent to which systematic prompts versus human-in-the-loop collaborative approaches reduce harmful bias while maintaining copy effectiveness remains underexplored in advertisement writing contexts.

## Key Definitions
**Value Alignment:** Adherence of outputs to a predefined set of values, including fairness (no stereotyping or discriminatory assumptions), inclusivity (gender-neutral, culturally sensitive language), truthfulness (no misleading claims), and safety (no harmful or regulated claims without disclaimers).

**Bias in Advertisement Copy:** Any systematic disparity across target demographics in the presence of stereotypes, harmful language, misleading claims, or quality indicators that could be unfairly allocated (e.g., more generous offers or more positive tone to one group vs another for similar briefs).

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** A collaborative approach where human evaluators provide real-time feedback, corrections, and guidance to AI systems, enabling adaptive learning and contextual ethical decision-making.

## Objectives
1. Quantify how different prompt design approaches influence bias and quality in AI-generated advertisement copy
2. Compare the effectiveness of systematic versus human-collaborative approaches to ethical AI alignment
3. Assess the scalability and efficiency trade-offs between automated and collaborative ethical AI systems
4. Develop a replicable evaluation protocol for value alignment in AI advertisement writing assistants

## Research Questions and Hypotheses

### RQ1: How does systematic value alignment (Room B) affect bias and quality compared to baseline conditions (Room A)?
**H1:** Room B will demonstrate significantly reduced bias metrics (toxicity, stereotyping, demographic parity gaps) while maintaining acceptable advertisement quality scores compared to Room A baseline.

### RQ2: Does human-in-the-loop collaboration (Room C) provide superior bias mitigation and ethical alignment compared to systematic approaches (Room B)?
**H2:** Room C will achieve greater bias reduction and improved contextual appropriateness compared to Room B, demonstrating the added value of human oversight in AI ethical alignment.

### RQ3: What are the efficiency and scalability trade-offs between systematic and collaborative approaches to ethical AI content generation?
**H3:** Room C will show superior ethical outcomes but at increased time and resource costs compared to Room B, providing insights for practical deployment decisions.

### RQ4: How do different ethical alignment approaches affect advertisement effectiveness and creative quality?
**H4:** Both Room B and Room C will maintain advertisement effectiveness comparable to Room A while achieving superior ethical alignment, demonstrating that ethical AI does not compromise business objectives.

#### Room B: Systematic Value-Aligned Configuration  
- **Purpose:** Test effectiveness of comprehensive, programmed ethical guidelines
- **Configuration:** Systematic implementation of ethical framework with automated bias prevention
- **Ethical Principles:** Beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice
- **System Features:** Built-in bias checking protocols, inclusive language requirements, diversity standards
- **Expected Outcomes:** Consistently ethical content with reduced bias across all outputs

#### Room C: Human-in-the-Loop Value-Aligned Configuration
- **Purpose:** Evaluate collaborative human-AI approach to ethical content generation
- **Configuration:** Systematic ethics plus continuous human oversight and feedback integration
- **Human Oversight:** Real-time review, collaborative refinement, adaptive learning from corrections
- **Expected Outcomes:** Adaptively improving ethical alignment with contextual awareness

### Experimental Protocol

#### Content Generation Tasks
- **Product Categories:** 4 standardized categories
