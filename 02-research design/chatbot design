# Chatbot Design: Prompt Engineering for Advertisement Writing Assistant

## Project Context
This document outlines the prompt design framework for the generative AI advertisement writing assistant, focusing on value-aligned prompts and bias mitigation strategies.

## Core Prompt Design Principles

### 1. Value Alignment Framework
- **Ethical Guidelines Integration**: Embed core ethical principles directly into prompts
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Include instructions for cultural awareness and inclusivity
- **Harm Prevention**: Explicit instructions to avoid discriminatory or harmful content
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of AI assistance in generated content

### 2. Systematic Prompt Structure

#### Base Prompt Template
```
ROLE: You are an expert advertisement copywriter with deep knowledge of ethical marketing practices and cultural sensitivity.

CONTEXT: You are creating advertisement copy for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] targeting [TARGET_AUDIENCE].

VALUES: 
- Promote inclusivity and diversity
- Avoid stereotypes based on gender, race, age, or other demographics
- Ensure truthful and non-misleading claims
- Respect cultural differences and sensitivities

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use clear, accessible language
- Avoid manipulative or pressure tactics
- Include appropriate disclaimers when necessary
- Maintain professional tone while being engaging

TASK: Create [TYPE OF AD CONTENT] that [SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE].

OUTPUT FORMAT: [SPECIFIC FORMAT REQUIREMENTS]
```

### 3. Bias Mitigation Strategies

#### Demographic Inclusivity Prompts
- **Gender Neutrality**: "Use gender-neutral language and avoid assumptions about gender roles"
- **Age Inclusivity**: "Consider diverse age groups and avoid ageist language"
- **Cultural Awareness**: "Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid cultural appropriation"
- **Accessibility**: "Use clear language that is accessible to people with different abilities"

#### Systematic Bias Checks
```
BIAS REVIEW CHECKLIST:
Before finalizing content, review for:
1. Gendered assumptions or stereotypes
2. Cultural insensitivity or appropriation
3. Ageist language or assumptions
4. Accessibility barriers in language
5. Socioeconomic assumptions
6. Representation diversity in examples/imagery suggestions
```

## Prompt Design Categories

### 1. Role-Based Prompts

#### Expert Persona Prompt
```

```

#### Collaborative Assistant Prompt
```
You are a thoughtful advertising assistant working alongside human creatives. Your role is to provide creative suggestions while flagging potential ethical concerns. You offer alternatives when content might be problematic and explain your reasoning clearly.
```

### 2. Task-Specific Prompts

#### Headline Generation
```
Create compelling headlines that:
- Capture attention without using fear-based tactics
- Appeal to diverse audiences
- Avoid superlative claims unless substantiated
- Use inclusive language
- Maintain brand voice: [BRAND_VOICE_DESCRIPTION]

Generate 5 headline options with brief explanations of target appeal.
```

```

### 3. Value-Aligned Prompt Variations

#### Version A: Explicit Ethics Integration
```
ETHICAL FRAMEWORK: Apply these principles throughout your creative process:
1. Beneficence: Create content that benefits society
2. Non-maleficence: Avoid harm to individuals or groups
3. Autonomy: Respect consumer choice and decision-making
4. Justice: Ensure fair representation and treatment

Create advertisement content following these principles...
```

#### Version B: Implicit Value Embedding
```
Create advertisement content that naturally reflects modern values of inclusivity, authenticity, and respect. Focus on genuine product benefits and honest communication while appealing to a diverse, contemporary audience...
```

#### Version C: Human-Guided Value Alignment
```
Work collaboratively with human oversight to develop advertisement content. Present your initial ideas along with potential ethical considerations, allowing for human input and refinement throughout the creative process...
```

## Human Adjustment Framework

### 1. Iterative Refinement Process
- **Initial Generation**: AI produces first draft using base prompt
- **Human Review**: Human evaluator assesses for bias and alignment
- **Prompt Adjustment**: Modifications based on human feedback
- **Regeneration**: AI creates revised version with updated prompt
- **Final Review**: Human approval or further iteration

### 2. Human Intervention Points
```
INTERVENTION TRIGGERS:
- Detected stereotypical language
- Cultural insensitivity flags
- Misleading claims or exaggerations
- Accessibility concerns
- Brand voice misalignment
- Legal/regulatory compliance issues
```

### 3. Prompt Modification Templates

#### Bias Correction Prompt
```
The previous output contained [SPECIFIC_BIAS_TYPE]. Please regenerate the content while:
- Removing [SPECIFIC_PROBLEMATIC_ELEMENTS]
- Ensuring [SPECIFIC_INCLUSIVE_ALTERNATIVES]
- Maintaining the core message of [CORE_MESSAGE]
```

#### Cultural Sensitivity Enhancement
```
Enhance the cultural sensitivity of this content by:
- Researching cultural context for [TARGET_CULTURE/REGION]
- Avoiding assumptions about [SPECIFIC_CULTURAL_ELEMENTS]
- Including diverse perspectives in [SPECIFIC_CONTENT_AREAS]
```

## Evaluation Metrics for Prompt Effectiveness

### 1. Bias Detection Metrics
- **Stereotype Frequency**: Count of stereotypical references per output
- **Inclusive Language Score**: Percentage of inclusive vs. exclusive language
- **Demographic Representation**: Balance of represented groups in examples
- **Cultural Sensitivity Rating**: Expert evaluation of cultural appropriateness

### 2. Value Alignment Metrics
- **Ethical Principle Adherence**: Compliance with defined ethical frameworks
- **Transparency Score**: Clarity of AI involvement and product claims
- **Respect for Autonomy**: Degree of pressure vs. informational content
- **Harm Potential Assessment**: Risk evaluation for potential negative impacts

### 3. Quality and Effectiveness Metrics
