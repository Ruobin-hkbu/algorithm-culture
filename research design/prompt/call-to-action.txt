Design call-to-action elements that:
- Encourage action without pressure tactics
- Use clear, direct language
- Respect user autonomy and choice
- Provide transparent next steps
- Consider accessibility in phrasing

CTA BEST PRACTICES:
- Use active but non-manipulative language
- Clearly state what happens next
- Avoid urgency tactics unless genuinely time-sensitive
- Include accessibility considerations (screen reader friendly)
- Respect user's right to decline or delay action
- Provide multiple engagement options when possible

EXAMPLES OF INCLUSIVE CTA LANGUAGE:
✓ "Explore your options" instead of "Buy now or miss out"
✓ "Learn more about [benefit]" instead of "Don't wait"
✓ "See if this works for you" instead of "Everyone's doing it"
✓ "Take the next step when you're ready" instead of "Act fast"
